                        </div>
                        <p class="introduction">"End of the Line," a short story by Jonathan Franzen, about the summer of a young woman's first sexual encounter, appears in this week's issue. In this 1997 essay, Franzen looks with dismay at how popular sex manuals handle their subject, and discusses the difficult relationship between sex and the written word. Franzen is the author of three novels, including "The Corrections," which will be published in September.</p>
                        <p class="descender">In the erotic broadsheets of the <span class="italic">Times</span>, which every morning lies on my breakfast table, silently awaiting my attention, there recently appeared what seemed to me a wholly reasonable Op-Ed piece by Adam Hochschild on the horror of airport television. "At gates cursed with the TV's," Hochschild wrote, "most of the passengers are trying to talk, work or read. But the penetrating TV noise needles itself into the conversations and onto the pages." His complaint soon brought replies from the Refiners, Resonators, and Rebutters who typically write letters to the <span class="italic">Times</span>. One Refiner suggested that airport TVs might play silently with captions. One Resonator wrote movingly of the kindred horror of "smelling and hearing popcorn" in movie theatres; another invited readers to "try spending a night in any moderately priced hotel without enduring the buzz-muffle of televised talk." (The rage palpable in the word "buzz-muffle"! Nothing more reliably bolsters my faith in humanity than the dyspepsia of letters to the <span class="italic">Times</span>.) There was also, however, a classic Rebuttal from the president of Turner Private Networks, who claimed, bizarrely, that airport TV is "not intrusive" and, more persuasively, that Hochschild is "more alone than he might think." Apparently, Nielsen surveys show that ninety-five per cent of air travellers believe that television enhances the airport environment, and eighty-nine per cent believe that "it makes the time spent in an airport more worthwhile." I pitied Hochschild when I read this. Here he is, trying bravely to give voice to a silent majority of sufferers, hoping to incite communal outrage, when along comes somebody with a figure—<span class="italic">ninety</span>-<span class="italic">five per cent</span>—to knock his legs out from under him. He's mugged by a norm.</p>
                        <p>This business of norms, which are a fixture of the information age—as friends or as tyrants, depending on how normal you are—was on my mind this winter when I embarked on a survey of contemporary popular sex books and was confronted with evidence that I am one of the few heterosexual men in America who are not turned on by elaborate lingerie. In bookstores, pop sex books are usually shelved under Health (a topic of such importance to the culture that all the books now published, including novels, could arguably be shelved there), and, since sexual "health" is impossible to define objectively, they offer the reader a uniquely rich array of normative pronouncements. "Matching lacy bra and panties, garter belt and stockings, bustiers, G-strings, and teddies—most men can't get enough of this stuff," Sydney Biddle Barrows, the Mayflower Madam, writes in "Just Between Us Girls." She later adds, "Whatever the reason, bustiers and merry widows seem to be almost universally popular garments." Dr. Susan Block, in "The 10 Commandments of Pleasure," commands the female reader, "Wear lingerie," and explains that "men who love sex love a woman who thinks about it, dresses up for it." Susan Crain Bakos, the author of "Sexational Secrets," concurs: "Men love it when you come to bed in high heels, bustier, and stockings." Lest these generalizations seem unscientific, the authors of "Sex: A Man's Guide" report that, according to their survey of <span class="italic">Men</span>'<span class="italic">s Health</span> readers, lingerie is "without a doubt . . . the U.S. male's favorite erotic aid."</p>
                        <p>I have no objection to a nice bra, still less to being invited to remove one. But brothelwear of the kind sold at Frederick's of Hollywood or Victoria's Secret seems to me scarcely less hokey than a Super Bowl half-time show. What I feel when I hear that the mainstream actually <span class="italic">buys</span> this stuff is the same garden-variety alienation I feel on learning that Hootie &amp; the Blowfish sold thirteen million copies of their first record, or that the American male's dream date is Cindy Crawford. In a sense, I'm proud of not being like everybody else. Like everybody else, though, I'm anxious about sex, and with sex the recognition that I'm not like everybody else leads directly to the worry that I'm not as good as—or, at any rate, not having as much fun as—everybody else.</p>
                        <p>Sexual anxiety is primal: physical love has always carried the risk that one's most naked self will be rejected. If Americans today are especially anxious, the consensus seems to be that it's because of "changing sex roles" and "media images of sex" and so forth. In fact, we're simply experiencing the anxiety of a free market. Contraception and the ease of divorce have removed the fetters from the economy of sex, and, like the citizens of present-day Dresden and Leipzig, we all want to believe we're better off under a regime in which even the poorest man can dream of wealth. But as the old walls of repression tumble down, many Americans—discarded first wives, who are like the workers displaced from a Trabant factory; or sexually inept men, who are the equivalent of command-economy bureaucrats—have grown nostalgic for the old state monopolies. What are The Rules if not an attempt to re-regulate an economy run scarily amok?</p>
                        <p>Until The Rules become universal, though, such comfort as can be found in the market economy comes principally from norms. Are you worried about the size of your penis? According to "Sex: A Man's Guide," most men's erections are between six and seven inches long. Worried about the architecture of your clitoris? According to Betty Dodson, in the revised edition of her "Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving," the variations are "astounding." Worried about frequency? "Americans do not have a secret life of abundant sex," the researchers of "Sex in America" concluded. Worried about how long it takes you to come? On average, says Sydney Barrows, it takes a woman eighteen minutes, a man just three.</p>
                        <p>The problem with relying on norms for comfort, however, is not only that you may fail to meet them but that you may meet them all too well. Who really wants to be sexually just like everybody else? Isn't the bedroom the place where I expect, rather, to feel special? Unique, even? The last thing I want is to be reminded of the vaguely icky fact that across the country millions of other people are having sex. This is the conundrum of the individual confronting masses about which he can't help knowing more than he'd like to know: I want to be alone, but not too alone. I want to be the same but different.</p>
                        <p class="descender">Popular sex books are only a small part of the sex industry, but one could argue that they are the most representative part, in that they are books. If a sexual fetish is understood as a displacement of genital energies, then language, even more than lingerie, is by far the most prevalent paraphilia in the country today. You can't show a bare breast on network television, but there's no limit to the backdoor prurience of talk about rape, incest, and sexual harassment. Cybersex and phone sex are a vastly more popular way of avoiding intimate fluids than is the worship of, say, knees or feet.</p>
                        <p>Although our pop sex writers seem to recognize the ascendance of language, they don't trust their readers to know how, or even when, to use it. In "Sex: A Man's Guide" we learn that lovers can be encouraged to talk dirty by making lists of "clinical" and "dirty" terms and comparing them. Dr. Block reels off forty-five possible pet names for a penis, including "peenie-weenie," "dipstick," and "lovepump," and commands her readers, "Take your pick." (More adventurous souls are urged to "make up something special" to suit their "very special wonder worm.") Susan Bakos cues Tantric lovers to the appropriate moment for "whispered terms of endearment," and she suggests that women who want to learn to talk dirty rent some video porn and study it carefully. "Once you are comfortable saying the words as a scriptwriter wrote them," she tells us, "you can personalize them to make it sound more like you speaking."</p>
                        <p>Reading a book of expert sexual instruction must rank near the bottom on the scale of erotic pastimes—somewhere below peeling an orange, not far above flossing. One problem is that, although the intention is precisely the opposite, these books collectively and individually make the world of sex seem very small. Never mind that there are only so many ways to fit body parts together or that Alex Comfort has already said and said well, in works that have sold better than eight million copies, pretty much all there is to say about it. There seems, in general, to be far too little lore to go around. Author after author derives the etymology of "cunnilingus," stresses the importance of doing "Kegel" exercises to strengthen the pubococcygeal muscles, and quotes Shakespeare on the topic of alcohol ("It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance"). Author after author insists that men are "visual creatures" and that the size of a penis matters less than what its owner does with it. When the lore runs out, the advice turns bleakly otiose. Dr. Block commands lovers, "Use babytalk, or at least 'pet names.' " In "Sexational Secrets," whose subtitle promises "exotic advice your mother never told you," Susan Bakos instructs masturbating men to use, "in various combinations," the Slow Single Stroke, the Fast Single Stroke, the Slow Two-Hand Stroke, the Fast Two-Hand Stroke, the Cupped Hand, the Finger Stroke, the Wrist Pump, the Slap, the Beat, the Rub, the Squeeze Stroke, the Open-Hand Stroke, and the Vagina Simulator Stroke; instructions for each are provided.</p>
                        <p>The italicized cheerfulness with which pop sex authors convey the useless and the banal is identical to that of the newscasters on airport TV, whose most striking talent is the ability to summon (or to fake, like an orgasm) fresh wonderment over the latest wrinkle in automobile safety. Trying to make fascinating and new what is neither, the authors tirelessly coin neologisms. They toss off "sexation," "primemate," "soulgasm," and "partnersex" with the supreme self-assurance that American audiences now demand from professional exhibitionists. Dr. Block, who calls herself an "erotic philosopher," illustrates her commandments with glimpses of her husband and herself in bed: "Max grunts like a bonobo chimp when he wants to go down on me, then moans and coos and tells me I'm delicious as he slurps away." For people who have never shared a fantasy with their lovers but "would like to try," the philosopher has this advice: "Watch <span class="italic">The Dr. Susan Block Show</span> together—that'll stimulate your fantasies!"</p>
                        <p>Not every pop sex book points to television quite this literally, but all the books seem bent on enmeshing sex (formerly life's one free pleasure) in the web of consumer spending. The reader is relentlessly exhorted to buy erotic videos, high-quality lingerie, candles, champagne, incense, oils, vibrators, perfumes, bubble-bath mix. Betty Dodson, Ph.D., sounds less like a prophet of an autoerotic utopia than like an infomercial host: she twice gives readers an address from which her videos may be ordered. Sidney Barrows suggests that renting luxury cars, wearing full-length fur coats, and taking expensive vacations will spice up the deadliest marriage. In "Sexational Secrets" Susan Bakos sets out to gather for the presumably impecunious reader the rarefied sexual know-how that members of the moneyed classes spend thousands to obtain. Apparently, the best sex is being had today by a lucky international élite who can afford six hundred and twenty-five dollars for multiple-orgasm workshops. Whether Bakos is interviewing "beautiful French courtesans" or a master of Kundalini yoga, she goes out of her way to stress the demographics of their clientele. They are "sheiks," they live in "secluded" suburban homes, they wear "business suits" and drink "flavored coffees."</p>
                        <p>As for the benefits of better sex, Betty Dodson reports that after "ending her slide show on the vulva a woman asked for a raise at work—and got it!" (Dodson attributes the woman's enhanced self-esteem to becoming "cunt positive.") And a raise at work is small potatoes compared with these authors' promises, expressed and implied, for a sexually liberated society as a whole. We can look forward to the disappearance of "prejudice and bigotry, heartache and misery, loneliness and violence"; the obsolescence of guns and missiles; the release of "the spirit of creativity" and the renewal of "the joy of living." Here is Dodson's "futuristic fantasy" of liberation:</p>
                        <p class="quote">It's New Year's Eve, 1999. All the television networks have agreed to let me produce "Orgasms Across America." Every TV screen will be showing high-tech, fine-art porn created by the best talent this country has to offer. At the stroke of midnight, the entire population will be masturbating to orgasm for World Peace.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was Mao's nasty inspiration that for a revolution truly to succeed it must never stop, and our own culture's version of non-stop revolution is collected and distilled in pop sex books: a ceaseless propaganda of self-congratulation wedded to a ceaseless invocation of the still powerful Enemy. If victory in the Sexual Revolution should ever be declared, people might no longer seek instruction and guidance from commercial sources. Consequently, our experts fill their books with constant reminders of how much better off we are than our grandparents. They laud the science of Alfred Kinsey and Masters and Johnson; they gleefully puncture the myth of the Freudian "mature" vaginal orgasm; they ridicule, under such banners as "The Annals of Ignorance," the hopeless stupidity of human beings a century ago. But the running dogs of sexual repression still hunt in packs outside our doors. One author blames "narrow, paternalistic, 1950s-style family values" and our "sex-negative, genital-shaming upbringing," while another blames "traditional marriage" and "anti-porn feminists who are intent on preserving their romantic illusions." Absolutely everyone blames religion. To hear the experts tell it, we live in a sexually repressed nation, under the dark thrall of Catholicism, fundamentalism, and ignorance.</p>
                        <p>I wonder what planet these experts are on. They seem blind to the way today's fifteen-year-olds act and dress, oblivious to the atmosphere of sexual license of which they themselves are the direct beneficiaries, and wholly ignorant of the large body of recent scholarship, by Peter Gay and others, that has revealed beneath the veneer of Victorian "repression" a universe of sexual experience as richly ramified as our own. There doubtless still exist a few American teen-agers who choose to give greater weight in their lives to religious scruples than to pop culture. But who is Dr. Susan Block to tell these kids they've chosen badly? As for the overwhelming majority of young people who pay more attention to "Baywatch" than to the Bible, they are indeed lucky to live in a time when it's common knowledge that, for example, women have orgasms and few, if any of them, are vaginal. It's worth pointing out, though, that what made this knowledge common was the growing power of women, rather than the other way around.</p>
                        <p>However manfully I resist nostalgia, Victorian silences appeal to me. Dr. Block, in an uncharacteristic fit of wisdom, observes, "The irony of creating a taboo is that, once something is forbidden, it often becomes very interesting." Sex in a time of ostensible repression at least had the benefit of carving out a space of privacy. Lovers defined themselves in opposition to the official culture, which had the effect of making every discovery <span class="italic">personal</span>. There's something profoundly boring about the vision that is promulgated, if only as an ideal, by today's experts: a long life of vigorous, non-stop, "fulfilling" sex, and the identical story in every household. Although it pains me to remember how innocent I was in my early twenties, I have no desire to rewrite my life. To do so would eliminate those moments when whole vistas of experience opened out of nowhere, moments when I thought, So <span class="italic">this</span> is what it's like. Just as every generation needs to feel that it has invented sex—"Sexual intercourse began / In nineteen sixty-three/(Which was rather late for me)" was Philip Larkin's imperfectly ironic lament—we all deserve our own dry spells and our own revolutions. They're what make our lives good stories.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, stories like these are easily lost amid the slick certitudes of our media culture: that a heavy enough barrage of information produces enlightenment, and that incessant communication produces communities. Susie Bright and Susan Block and Dr. Ruth are loud and cable-ready. You can turn them on, but you can't turn them off. They yammer on about the frenulum, the perineum, the G-spot, the squeeze technique, bonobo chimpanzees and vibrators, teddies and garter belts, "eargasms" and "toegasms." Their work <span class="italic">creates</span> the bumbling amateur. Their discovery of sexual "technique" <span class="italic">creates</span> a population bereft of technique. The popular culture they belong to thus resembles an MTV beach party. From the outside, the party looks like fun, but for passive viewers its most salient feature is that they haven't been invited to it. "Are some people having multiple orgasms . . . electrifying oral experiences, incredible and emotionally intense lovemaking sessions that last for hours?" Susan Bakos asks the reader. "Unbelievable as it may sound—yes. Why not you?" A lonely reader could be forgiven for replying: Because there's a television in my bedroom.</p>
                        <p class="descender">The term "paraphilia" connotes perversion, something unhealthy. But, while there's little doubt that our culture promotes a paraphiliac displacement from the genital to the verbal, this displacement is not intrinsically diseased. The reason that reading a sex book can assuage loneliness (at least momentarily) is that sex for human beings is as much imaginative as it is biological. When we make love, we forever have in our heads an image of ourselves making love. And, although substituting a hot text for a warm body may be nothing but a way of tricking our genitals, what's remarkable is that the trick so often works. When I was fourteen, I canvassed and recanvassed my Webster's Collegiate for words like "intercourse." Scouring "Ann Landers Talks to Teenagers About Sex" for the dirty bits, I was excited to learn that the mere sight of "a girl in a tight sweater" is sufficient to arouse a teen-age boy.</p>
                        <p>For the grownup who seeks such written thrills but lacks the resources to compile his own supply of frisson-inducing texts, there now exists "The Joy of Writing Sex: A Guide for Fiction Writers," a kind of para-paraphiliac volume, by the novelist Elizabeth Benedict. This new "Joy" consists mainly of sex scenes excerpted from the works of contemporary fiction writers and framed by Benedict's own chirpy, sanitizing glosses. Whatever subversive thrills "Portnoy's Complaint" might provide are unlikely to survive an analysis like this: "Roth manages to turn the cliché of the teenage boy's first visit to a whore into a rich, sidesplittingly funny scene that leads us back again to the themes of the novel, the struggle between being a good Jew and a good Jewish son and being as naughty as your libido begs you to be." Benedict confides that a big attraction of writing the manual was that she could "read sexy books and think for long periods of nothing but sex." That she considers this an enviable circumstance may explain the deep kinship—the quite striking parallels—between her product and the products of pop sex authors. Its price sticker is its destiny.</p>
                        <p>Like the pop-sexers, Benedict congratulates our age on its enlightenment and congratulates her readers on their good fortune in having come of age after the publication of "Fear of Flying." She alludes to the "incalculable tragedies of self-censorship" that befell authors in the dark ages before 1960, and she hints at the evil forces (Puritanism, fundamentalists, sexually repressive governments) that threaten our precarious liberty. Although she, like Dr. Block, briefly acknowledges the excitement that taboos generate ("Now that we can say anything, what else is there to say?"), pursuing this argument would undermine her project, so she doesn't. Similarly uneasy is her recognition that divorcing sex-scene technique from the larger challenges of writing good fiction is as useless as divorcing sexual technique from the challenge of loving someone. Good sex writing, it turns out, is a lot like good fiction writing in general. It has, she says, "tension, dramatic conflict, character development, insights, metaphors and surprises." These qualities are the Slow and Fast One- and Two-Handed Strokes to which Benedict returns, in various combinations, throughout the book. Avoid clichés, she advises—or at least "give them a unique twist." Try to "make the writing interesting." Don't forget: "You need not be explicit but you must be specific." And if it doesn't fit, you must acquit.</p>
                        <p>Although Benedict believes that she can liberate the reader from the "demons" of self-censorship, she's vague on exactly how this occurs. At one point, she implies that liberation is simply a matter of gumption: "Question: Who are your censors and how do you silence them? Answer: Just do it." But a book that intends to give us "permission to indulge" new possibilities requires an exemplary performer, and, as with Betty Dodson, whose "Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving" mainly retails the professional triumphs of Betty Dodson, the work that most interests Benedict is her own. She includes four substantial excerpts from her fiction, and she praises them with charming artlessness. ("These are emotionally complex scenes. . . . ") At the same time, she reminds us that <span class="italic">her</span> skills didn't come from any manual. In her own work, she says, she didn't "consciously try to create conflict or to inject surprises"—although, sure enough, she now realizes "how important those elements are."</p>
                        <p>The fraud of "The Joy of Writing Sex" is meaner than the fraud of sex manuals, since every man can be a king in bed and every women a queen but not everyone can be a successful novelist. Nietzsche said, "Books for all the world are always foul-smelling books; the smell of small people clings to them." The truth, of course, may be that I'm no larger than the next man. But who wants to know a truth like this? Just as every lover at some level believes that he makes love as it's made nowhere else on the planet, so every artist clings for dear life to the illusion that the art he's producing is vital, necessary, and unique.</p>
                        <p>Aesthetic élitism, sexual snobbery: these are not the reprehensible attitudes that our culture makes them out to be. They're the efforts of the individual to secure a small space of privacy within the prevailing din. All people should be élitists—and keep it to themselves.</p>
                        <p class="descender">The one welcome service that Benedict performs in "Joy" is her surgical removal of sex scenes from their context. The more sincerely explicit a novel's dirty bits are, I think, the more they beg to be removed. When I was a teen-ager, novels were Trojan horses by means of which titillation could sometimes be smuggled into my sheltered life. Over the years, though, I've come to dread the approach of sex scenes in serious fiction. Call it the orgasmic collapse: the more absorbing the story, the more I dread it. Often the sentences begin to lengthen Joyceanly. My own anxiety rises sympathetically with the author's, and soon enough the fragile bubble of the imaginative world is pricked by the hard exigencies of naming body parts and movements—the sameness of it all. When the sex is persuasively rendered, it tends to read autobiographically, and there are limits to my desire for immersion in a stranger's biochemistry. A few geniuses—Philip Roth may be one of them—have the skill or the bravado to get away with explicit sex, but in most novels, even otherwise excellent ones, the corporeal nomenclature is hopelessly contaminated through its previous use by writers whose aim is simply to turn the reader on.</p>
                        <p>Jacques Derrida once sought to demonstrate, in his sublimely contortionist essay "White Mythology," that language is such a self-contained system that even a word as basic as "sun" cannot be proved, by anyone using language, to refer to an objective, extralinguistic Sun. A candle is <span class="italic">like</span> a small sun, but the sun is <span class="italic">like</span> a large candle; examined closely, language turns out to operate through the lateral associations of metaphor, rather than through the vertical identifications of naming. So what is "sex"? Everything is like it, and it's like everything—like food, like drugs, like reading and writing, like deal-making, like war, like sport, like education, like the economy, like socializing. In the end, however, every orgasm is more or less the same. This may be why writing <span class="italic">about</span> sex is at once effective and boring. Language of the nominal, hot-slippery-cunt-ramrod-straight-dick variety both aims for and achieves its own closure. The orgasm is a kind of consumer purchase, and, one way or another, the language that attends it is always a kind of ad copy.</p>
                        
			  <p>Language <span class="italic">as</span> sex, on the other hand, 
				is fraught with the perils of an open-ended eros. When I'<span class="archivesubsection">m 
				in bed with a novel, I hope its author will be faithful to me. 
				Right now I'm reading Nick Hornby's "High Fidelity," a flawed 
				but beguiling sendup of male anxiety in which the narrator's girlfriend 
				leaves him for a former upstairs neighbor, a man he now remembers 
				was "something of a demon" in bed:</span></p>
			  <p class="quote"><span class="archivesubsection">"He goes on long 
				enough," I said one night, when we were both lying awake, staring 
				at the ceiling. "I should be so lucky," said Laura. This was a 
				joke. We laughed. Ha, ha, we went. Ha, ha, ha. I'm not laughing 
				now. Never has a joke filled me with such nausea and paranoia 
				and insecurity and self-pity and dread and doubt.<br>
				</span></p>
			  <p><span class="archivesubsection">When a full-blown sex scene finally 
				looms on the narrative horizon, a hundred pages into a novel that's 
				almost entirely about sex, my distaste at the prospect of orgasmic 
				collapse is mitigated by a rare circumstance: I'm actually finding 
				both the female love object (an American folk-rock singer) and 
				the setting (a barren flat in a barren London neighborhood) quite 
				sexy. Though I'm not looking forward to the hardened nipples and 
				spurted semen that seem certain to follow, I'm prepared to forgive 
				them, maybe even enjoy them. But when, after one last eight-page 
				delay for awkward negotiations and precoital anxiety, Hornby gets 
				his lovers into bed, the narrator abruptly declares, "I'm not 
				going into all that other stuff, the who-did-what-to-whom stuff." 
				Facing a choice between fidelity to "what happens" and fidelity 
				to his reader, Hornby doesn't let the reader down. In one simple, 
				curtain-dropping sentence he proves to me that he himself, at 
				some point in his reading, has experienced the same uncomfortable 
				suspense that I have just experienced, and for a moment, though 
				I'm alone in bed with a book, I don't feel alone. For a moment, 
				I belong</span> to a group neither as big as a statistically significant 
				sample nor as small as the naked self. It's a group of two, the 
				faithful writer and the trusting reader. We're different but the 
				same. <img src="./index01_files/gl_dingbat.gif" vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" alt=""></p>
